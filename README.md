# Deque

# Deque (Double-ended Queue) Implementation in Java

This project showcases the implementation of a double-ended queue (deque) data structure in Java. A deque allows elements to be added or removed from both ends efficiently. The project includes classes for deque, stack (implemented using deque), and queue (implemented using deque).

## Features

- **Deque**: The `deque` class provides basic operations such as insertion at the front and rear, deletion from the front and rear, as well as methods to check if the deque is empty or full.

- **Stack**: The `Stack` class utilizes the `deque` implementation to create a stack data structure. It includes methods for push, pop, peek, and getting the size of the stack.

- **Queue**: The `Queue` class also uses the `deque` implementation to create a queue data structure. It includes methods for enqueue, dequeue, peek, and getting the size of the queue.

## Usage

The project demonstrates the usage of the deque, stack, and queue classes with sample data.
